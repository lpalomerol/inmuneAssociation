Title: Set of tools defined to run systematically linear regressions with output variable normalized using bestNormalize functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Luis Palomero
Maintainer: Luis Palomero <lpalomerol@gmail.com>
Description: This package has been developed to allow running systematically linear regression for a group of varaibles easily. These regressions can be adjusted by a group of predefined covaraibles.
  Before running  each regression three big steps are applied: 
    - First of all we have removed users with empty data values and covariables without variability.
    - Then we have applied bestNormalize regression pipeline to output variable
    - Thirt step implies the application of Stepwise AIC pipeline to eliminate covariables potentially non informative.
  The main function output (systematic_regression) returns the results as 1-row data.frame object, ideally defined to run inside a loop.
